perfect, so now want to change these colors, i want complete black and blue colors, as in black background and its name is CareMate, want it to have dark and light mode, but dark mode is the default, Remove that information there 'database Ready' users cant see it.  Then add a footer.   Also please feel free to add anything neccessary for this to be a full app.

Above all lets make this a full app, then deploy it and start using it.
